# 🚀 PromptVerse: AI Prompt Marketplace Powered by Web3

PromptVerse is a next-generation AI prompt marketplace that leverages the power of Web3 and AI to create a decentralized, creator-friendly platform for buying, selling, and reselling AI prompts.

## 🌟 What is PromptVerse?

PromptVerse is not just a marketplace—it's a platform where creators can mint their AI prompts as digital assets (NFTs), sell them directly to users, and earn royalties every time their prompt is resold. With integrated AI, users also get smart suggestions for prompts, making discovery and creativity seamless.

### Key Features

- **Web3 Payments:** All transactions are handled using Ethereum (ETH), removing traditional payment gateways and enabling true digital ownership.
- **Prompt as NFT:** Each prompt is minted as a unique token on the blockchain, ensuring authenticity and traceable ownership.
- **Royalty System:** Original creators automatically receive royalties on every resale of their prompt, powered by smart contracts (ERC-721/ERC-1155 + ERC-2981).
- **AI-Powered Suggestions:** Integrated AI recommends prompts to users based on trends and interests.
- **Decentralized & Transparent:** All purchases, sales, and royalties are recorded on-chain for full transparency.
